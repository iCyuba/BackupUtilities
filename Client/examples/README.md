# Examples directory

You can use this directory to test out the utility.

There are 3 scripts for easier usage:

-   `clean.sh` - cleans the directory and runs `generate.sh`

-   `generate.sh` - generates random files to test with

-   `update.sh` - updates random testing files

`config.json`, `generated/` and `backup*/` are ignored by git.
